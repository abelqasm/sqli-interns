					As part of my learning path, I started with an introduction in C,
					which taught me the basics of programation with C preprocessor and the
					C standard library. Afterward i deepen into the c++ programming
					language which introduced me to the object-oriented programming
					paradigm when i learned to implement classes, objects, inheritance,
					and polymorphism, and other topycs like templates , exceptions and
					generic programs, afterward i continued my learning journey with web
					developement by starting with html css and javascript programming
					language, before jumping to work on some project with react and
					typescript that i will show you later on the next section
